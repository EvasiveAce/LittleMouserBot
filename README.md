# Little Mouser Discord Bot

This bot is for my personal Discord server, and is continuously hosted on a Raspberry Pi. I developed this bot to increase engagement, as well as to get the Discord developer badge. 

## How It Works
I developed this bot to work on a loop, revolving around an array of images. Every refresh period, as well as when the bot starts, it gathers every image in a chosen Discord channel. The loop allows it to keep getting new images, without having 
to manually update the array. The Raspberry Pi keeps it running indefinitely.

Server members are able to access the bot using Discord's in-app commands, or just using the appropriate command for the bot.
